the connection that we made cannot make the connection reliable like the server and client cannot commuicate continuously so apply another while here for the communication.

in the second while loop the server is giving the first input so the client will be listening first (the server starts the communication) and the client replies.

the both loops (in the server and the client) will run simultaniously that means the client must listen first because the client loop starts with listening for the message and printing and vice versa for the server.
